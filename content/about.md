I am a Computer Science & Engineering student and aspiring Vulnerability Researcher. I enjoy buying cheap IoT devices just to see if I can break into them and competing in CTFs. My journey started with IT support and Linux administration, but now I focus on:

*    **Hardware Hacking**: UART, SPI, Bootloader glitching and more.

*    **Firmware Analysis**: Dissecting binaries to find secrets.

*    **Home Lab**: Self-hosting VPNs and network infrastructure.

I speak English, French, and Arabic , and I'm currently based in the Netherlands.
